# Interview Outcome Prediction

This project simulates and predicts interview outcomes based on:
- Session-level metadata
- Panelist behavior (strictness)
- Candidate behavioral traits

## Phases Covered
- **Phase A**: Binary classification (Accept/Reject)
- **Phase B**: Multiclass classification (Exit round: R1, R2, R3, Accepted)
- **Phase C**: Advanced modeling using both panelist and candidate behavior.

## Models Used
- **XGBoost** (Binary and Multiclass)
- **LightGBM** (Binary and Multiclass)
